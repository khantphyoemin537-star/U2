# 🎨 COLORED INLINE BUTTONS — Bot API 9.4 (Feb 2026) added a `style` field to keyboard buttons,
# letting a button carry a background color instead of the permanent transparent look every
# button had before: bg_success (green), bg_danger (red), bg_primary (blue), or none (default
# transparent — still the recommended look for neutral actions, per Telegram's own docs). The
# style flag lives on every keyboard button type (callback, switch_inline, url, ...), so both
# helpers below share the same _apply_button_style() logic.
#
# Both build the button through the exact same Button.inline()/Button.switch_inline() everything
# else in this file already uses (identical bytes-encoding/validation), then ADD a .style
# attribute — wrapped in try/except so that on any Telethon version that doesn't know about
# types.KeyboardButtonStyle yet, this silently no-ops back to a plain transparent button instead
# of crashing every send/edit call that uses it.
# ==========================================

    transparent). Only style the one button in a row that should stand out; leave its

# 🗃️ BOT STATE — every in-memory runtime cache/counter/game-state dict the bot keeps, in one
# place, instead of ~28 loose module-level globals scattered across the file. Gives us:
#   1. cleanup_expired() — a single periodic sweep that bounds memory on a 512MB Render
#      instance instead of relying on each cache to (maybe) self-prune on its own.
#   2. One obvious place to look when auditing "what does this process hold in RAM".
#
# BACKWARD COMPAT: right after this class, every attribute is ALSO exposed as a bare
# module-level name (e.g. `active_group_spawns = bot_state.active_group_spawns`). Dicts/sets/
# defaultdicts are mutable reference types in Python, so that bare name and the attribute on
# bot_state point at the literal same object — `active_group_spawns[x] = y` anywhere else in
# this file mutates bot_state.active_group_spawns too, and vice versa. This means every one of
# the hundreds of pre-existing references to these globals throughout the file keeps working
# completely unchanged; nothing needed to be renamed at the call sites.

# spend far more than they actually had, or drive their balance negative.

    (one query, a handful of numbered batches at most) and safe to call on every startup — an

    this used to be the very last line of create_indexes(), which only ever runs inside

    does NOT block bot startup (see that function's own docstring). Two problems fell out of

    function aborted it right there, so this line was sometimes never reached at all — silently,
    since _create_indexes_background() only prints the error; (2) even on a clean run, the
    owner could hit /mergele or /addle #N in the first few seconds after a restart, before this
    background task got around to running. Either way, every pre-existing LE batch stayed
    permanently un-numbered, and /mergele #A #B / /addle #N had nothing to look up.
    It's now awaited directly and unconditionally in run_bot1_forever(), the same place as the
    other one-time migrations (run_usd_to_star_migration, run_trivia_hard_tier_wipe, etc.) —
    so it always finishes before bot1 can receive a single /mergele or /addle command, and a
    failure here surfaces the same way theirs do (the connect loop logs it and retries) instead
    of vanishing into create_indexes()'s catch-all."""

# 🎯 ULTRA SCARCITY CAP — CORRECTED 2026-08 (previous version of this note was wrong): the cap
# is PER-CHARACTER, not pooled across the tier. Every individual ULTRA (Rarity No.1) character
# gets its own spawn_limit of ULTRA_DEFAULT_CATCH_LIMIT copies, via the exact same generic
# spawn_limit/spawn_count mechanism every other capped character already uses (see /addchar,
# /editchar, /addle) — there is nothing ULTRA-specific about the mechanism itself anymore, only
# the default number applied to it. /addchar defaults new Rarity-1 characters to this limit
# automatically unless the owner explicitly gives a different CatchLimit; see
# run_ultra_catch_limit_migration() near startup for backfilling characters added before this
# fix. Once an individual ULTRA character's own spawn_count reaches its own spawn_limit it:
#   1. stops appearing as a wild spawn for THAT character specifically (others are unaffected)
#      — see trigger_dynamic_spawn's generic spawn_limit filter, and
#   2. stops being purchasable via the Owner Shop /buy or the /show gallery's 🛒 button, for
#      THAT character specifically — see execute_star_shop_purchase's generic spawn_limit
#      check, which (also fixed here) now actually counts Shop purchases toward the same cap
#      instead of letting the Shop mint unlimited fresh copies past it.
# From that point on the only way to get a copy is /gift or /trade from an existing owner —

    limit actually required, on top of its own deliberate safety margin — the two stacked into
    way more pages than necessary. Tags are stripped and entities decoded here now, so this
    measures the same length Telegram does. Fancy-font letters (used for rarity names) and

# the same bot account repeatedly hitting the same handful of messages in the SAME storage

# media already retries on below — it can also just silently fail to render, exactly matching

    you attach it to a BRAND NEW message) is only valid for a limited window after it was
    obtained — reusing the SAME cached media object to send new messages later (which is
    exactly what caching is for) will eventually raise errors.FileReferenceExpiredError once
    enough time has passed since that reference was fetched. This is almost certainly what
    caused spawns/collect/haido to start failing after the caching change shipped: the first
    send after caching works fine (fresh reference), but every later reuse of that same
    cached entry carries a reference that's progressively more likely to have gone stale —
    which is also why it got WORSE over time and eventually spawns stopped entirely, instead
    of failing consistently from the start.
    On errors.FileReferenceExpiredError specifically, or a handful of other media-related RPC
    errors that can mean the same underlying thing (a stale reference Telegram didn't accept),

# 🚨 AML "BUST" — comedic flavor event AND bot3's real max-single-bet ceiling
# ==========================================
# Root cause of the currency-inflation problem this was built to close off: none of bot3's
# games ever capped how large a single bet could be. With payout multipliers well into double
# digits and NO ceiling, a player only ever needs a handful of lucky high-multiplier wins in a
# row — each one multiplying their ENTIRE current balance — to snowball into an astronomical,
# uncountable number. That's exactly the pattern of the /richest leaderboard: each rank a huge
# multiple of the next, not a gradual accumulation.
# AML_BUST_THRESHOLD closes that off directly: no bet can ever be placed at or above it, full
# stop — dressed up as a satirical "money-laundering investigation" instead of a flat error, per
# request. It is flavor text only; nothing here is a real restriction on the user's account
# outside the game layer.
# 🩹 2026-08 USD RETIREMENT: was 1,000,000 USD, divided down by USD_PER_STAR (100,000) to stay
# proportional to the post-migration ⭐ Star economy — but that division landed on exactly 10⭐,
# which is BELOW every game's own bet presets even at the time (/slot alone went up to 500⭐).
# 🩹 FIX (2026-08, per owner request to raise /slot's max bet to 50,000⭐): now a flat ⭐ value
# set with headroom above SLOT_MAX_BET, so it's back to being the emergency backstop it was
# meant to be, not something that silently blocks every normal max-size bet with a comedic
# "AML bust" instead of a real answer.

# 🩹 FIX (per deploy crash log — Python 3.14 + Telethon 1.37.0): "RuntimeError: There is no
# current event loop in thread 'MainThread'" at TelegramClient(...) construction below. Python
# 3.14 removed asyncio.get_event_loop()'s old behavior of silently creating a new loop when
# none exists for the current thread (https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99949) — it now
# raises RuntimeError instead. Telethon's TelegramClient.__init__ reads self.loop immediately
# (a property that tries asyncio.get_running_loop() first, then falls back to exactly that now-
# removed get_event_loop() behavior), and since bot1/bot2/bot3 below are constructed at plain
# module level — long before asyncio.run(start_system()) at the bottom of this file ever starts
# a loop — there's no running loop yet at this point, so it hits the broken fallback path and
# crashes before the bot even gets a chance to start. Explicitly creating and registering a loop
# here (only if one isn't already set) works around it: asyncio.run() further down creates and
# uses its OWN loop when it actually runs, and Telethon's self.loop property re-resolves to
# THAT running loop on every later access anyway (it's evaluated fresh each time, never cached)
# — this throwaway loop only needs to exist long enough for the constructor below not to crash.

# order) it always runs first. If the same user taps again inside the cooldown window, we
# answer the tap immediately with a small non-blocking toast — so the button doesn't look

# ==========================================
# 💠 VLT is the ONLY currency the Market (Owner Shop /buy + Owner /sell buyback) accepts now —

# as a reward (catches, quiz, daily, referral, casino, etc.) and (2) exchanging into VLT via
# /buyvlt & /sellvlt at the live rate below. Unlike Star's old fixed USD peg, this rate is
# allowed to drift on its own within [VLT_RATE_MIN, VLT_RATE_MAX] — see vlt_drift_loop().
# 🩹 CHANGED (2026-09, per owner request — card values had been quietly devalued to almost
# nothing in real terms): at the old 5-7⭐/💠 rate, even the top ULTRA card (7,500💠, see
# RARITY_VLT_PRICE) converted to only ~75-105 MMK at Telegram's own Star exchange rate
# (1,000,000⭐ = 2,000 MMK, i.e. 500⭐ = 1 MMK) — nowhere near what a rare card should be worth.
# The owner's target was 4,000-13,000 MMK for that same top card, which solves to a new
# 266.67-866.67⭐/💠 rate: MMK target ÷ (RARITY_VLT_PRICE["ULTRA"] × (2000/1_000_000)), i.e.
# target ÷ 15. VLT_STARTING_RATE and VLT_DRIFT_STEP_MAX are both rescaled by the same ~300x
# factor as the range itself, so the market keeps drifting with the same relative volatility
# (~7.5% of the full range per tick) it always had — nothing about vlt_drift_loop() changed,

# account taps option 2 for a guaranteed win. 4 options doesn't eliminate that coordination

# design line already drawn for Premium's star_reward-only bonus above. Rolled once per spawn,

# the spawn_target doubling in global_message_counter_handler). This makes it slower to farm
# rather than impossible, without shutting the feature off for small-but-real communities.

# spawns (random.choices, see weighted_random_trivia_difficulty()). 🩹 CHANGED: Easy's weight
# was cut hard (35 → 12) per owner request — it was showing up too often now that there's a
# much bigger question pool across all 5 tiers; Normal/Hard now carry the bulk of spawns
# instead of Easy dominating. "star_min"/"star_max" is that tier's ⭐ reward range for the first
# correct tap — together the 5 tiers span the full 200-1500⭐ range the owner asked for, split
# proportionally by difficulty. "points" is how many Trivia Points (see TRIVIA_RANKS) a correct
# answer at that tier is worth; "wrong_penalty" is how many Trivia Points a WRONG tap costs —
# deliberately smaller than what a correct answer at that tier would have earned, but still
# scaled by difficulty, so a wrong guess on an Extreme Hard question costs more than whiffing
# an Easy one. Points are NOT boosted by Premium — only the ⭐ Star reward is
# (PREMIUM_QUIZ_REWARD_MULTIPLIER) — so the rank ladder stays skill/participation based rather
# than pay-to-win.
# 🩹 NEW "star_penalty" (per owner request — Star/VLT inflation fix): a wrong answer now ALSO
# costs real ⭐ Star, not just Trivia Points — trivia is one of the most-played features, so it
# doubles as a real currency sink now. Set at 20% of that tier's star_min (owner-adjustable —
# tune to taste), same ascending-by-difficulty shape as wrong_penalty. If a player's balance
# can't cover it, they pay what they have and the rest becomes star_debt, auto-settled out of
# their balance the next time they earn Star from a catch, /daily, or a correct trivia answer
# (see settle_star_debt) — never lets a balance go negative. See trivia_answer_callback.

    a genuine UserNotParticipantError (Telegram explicitly saying "not in this chat") is
    trusted as a real False now. Any other failure is inconclusive, so — same "unknown fails
    open" philosophy as get_cached_group_member_count_nowait above — it's treated as a pass
    for THIS check and, critically, is never written to the cache, so the very next attempt
    gets a fresh real lookup instead of being stuck behind a wrong cached verdict.

    force_confirm: used by force_sub_gate (and the inline-query gate) right before they
    actually block someone — NOT on the normal fast-path check above it. A plain (False) call
    is happy to trust a cached "no" for up to FORCE_SUB_MEMBERSHIP_NEGATIVE_TTL seconds; that's
    fine for the common case, but leaves a small window where someone who joined a moment
    *after* that "no" got cached (e.g. their join ChatAction was itself missed/delayed — see
    force_sub_join_tracker — on top of the original "bot was offline when they joined" case
    this was all added for) would still get blocked for the rest of that window. force_confirm
    ignores a cached "no" and re-checks live with Telegram instead — UNLESS the last live check
    for this user was inside FORCE_SUB_CONFIRM_DEBOUNCE seconds ago, in which case that result
    is reused rather than firing a near-duplicate API call a moment later for the same instant.
    Net effect: a block decision is never based on a verdict more than ~1 second old, while a
    person spamming a blocked command still costs at most ~1 live lookup per second, not one
    per keystroke. A cached "yes" is always trusted regardless of force_confirm — the worst
    case there is a few extra seconds of access right after actually leaving, which is the
    harmless direction to be wrong in for a card-collecting game."""

    # crash, baccarat, color-tower, lucky-pick, limbo, over/under, tower) and /slot itself was
    # rebuilt to use Telegram's own native dice-message animation instead of hand-edited

    #     upload of a big file could hang past whatever the underlying connection tolerates.

# ==========================================
# 🧹 /importcleanup — bulk-apply a corrected "Series" (category) name and/or a renumbered
# "New Character ID" from an edited /exportchars-shaped CSV (2026-09, per owner request —
# categories had accumulated case/punctuation duplicates over time, e.g. "Hololive" vs
# "hololive", and character IDs had ended up essentially random instead of reflecting the
# order characters were actually added).
#
# Same two-step confirm idiom as /importthemes: reply to the edited CSV with /importcleanup
# for a dry-run PREVIEW (nothing written), then /importcleanup confirm on the same file to
# actually apply it. Matches rows by the existing "Character ID" column; a blank or unchanged
# "New Character ID" cell leaves that character's ID alone, and a blank "Series" cell leaves
# its category alone — so this is safe to run with only SOME rows filled in, not just a full
# 1-to-N renumber.
#
# 🩹 ID RENAME SAFETY: characters_base_data has a UNIQUE index on char_id. Renaming char_ids
# directly (old -> new) risks a duplicate-key error mid-batch the moment any batch's old/new
# values overlap each other (row A's new ID is row B's old ID, etc.) — which a full renumber
# hits constantly. So this always goes old -> a throwaway "__TMP__..." id -> new id in two
# clearly separate passes, which can never collide with anything real. harem.char_id / fav_card
# (non-unique index) and the legacy "characters" collection (no unique index on id/char_id —
# only "name" is unique there) don't have that risk, so those go old -> new directly, in one

# refreshing its display string in place. This command is for the other case: RARITY_EMOJI (or

# sitting in that tier — plus every already-caught copy of them — is still showing the OLD
# stored string, since /addchar (and /cr) only stamp that string in at the moment they touch a
# character, not automatically on every code deploy.
#
# One tier per run (/changeallrarity no<N>), same interface as /cr, so it's obvious which tier
# just got refreshed; run it again for each tier whose emoji actually changed.
#
# Deliberately does NOT re-post to CHARACTER_CHANNEL_ID the way /cr's bulk form does — /cr's
# bulk form is sized for an owner-curated list (tens of characters); a whole rarity tier can
# easily be hundreds, and at /cr's flood-safe 3s/post pacing that's tens of minutes of channel
# spam for what's purely a cosmetic re-stamp, not a real content change worth announcing.

# 🎯 CATCH_RACE_JUDGE_WINDOW — 2026-08, per owner report (repeated, and confirmed via
# screenshot even AFTER the release_spawn timing fix): "first person to type it doesn't get
# it, a later person does." The previous fix (no `await` at all between arriving in
# catch_handler and the atomic claim, so — in theory — whichever racer's task got dispatched
# first would reach the lock first) was necessary but evidently NOT sufficient: it assumes
# asyncio task-scheduling order faithfully mirrors real send order, but that's not a
# guarantee Telethon's update dispatch actually makes — under real load, a later-sent message
# CAN still get its handler task scheduled to run before an earlier one's, for reasons outside
# this bot's control.
#
# So the win condition no longer depends on task-scheduling order AT ALL. Every valid /obtain
# attempt for a spawn is now buffered for CATCH_RACE_JUDGE_WINDOW seconds, and the winner is
# picked by comparing `event.id` — the message ID Telegram itself assigns, strictly increasing
# per chat, authoritative and independent of any bot-side processing jitter. This is a genuine
# trade-off: EVERY catch (including an uncontested solo one) now waits out this window before
# the catch even begins, in exchange for a fairness guarantee that no longer depends on
# framework/scheduler internals. See catch_handler for the buffering + judging logic.

        #                     display name + a premium crown + newline)             ≈ 160 units
        #   filter line     (🎚️ "Filter: " + a generously-long rarity label)         ≈  65 units
        #   page/count line ("Page 999/999 · Unique 9999 · Total 99999" + \n\n)      ≈  45 units

    renders them in the same side-by-side grid as photos, instead of a tall vertical list.
    No title is passed — a visible title/description on a document-type result is what makes
    it render as a text row instead of a clean grid tile on some clients; omitting it (it's
    optional) keeps every tile a plain thumbnail. The name still shows up in the caption once

    InputBotInlineResult*. This function was a plain `def` returning that coroutine directly,
    and every call site below appended it straight into `results` with no await either — so
    every single tile in every inline gallery was a bare coroutine object, never the real
    result Telegram needs. Telethon warns about this to stderr ("coroutine was never awaited")
    rather than raising, which is why it failed silently instead of erroring loudly. This is

    # storage_msg_id vs. a get_messages failure vs. something else), and answering with a
    # visible switch_pm message instead of a bare empty list at least tells the person tapping
    # the button that something went wrong, rather than looking like total silence.

# ==========================================
# Owned forever once bought (kept in users_catcher_col.owned_cosmetics), but only ONE item per
# category can be equipped at a time (equipped_title / equipped_emblem / equipped_frame).
# Equipped title+emblem show as a line on /profile; equipped frame decorates the card header.
# No gameplay effect whatsoever — this exists purely as another place to spend ⭐.
# 🩹 2026-08 USD RETIREMENT: these prices used to be USD wallet_balance amounts (5-50,000).
# Re-tuned to a comparable ⭐ Star progression for the post-migration economy — same relative
# shape (starter item cheap, prestige item a genuine long-term goal, sitting comfortably under
# the top "Hold 25,000 Star" wealth achievement) rather than the same raw digits relabeled —
# owner-adjustable, tune to taste.

# good", not "did I lose everything", by design.
# 🎲 Loot table tuned so the EXPECTED payout sits comfortably under BOX_PRICE (a real house
# edge, same principle as the Casino games), while the top JACKPOT tier is a genuine, rare
# "worth talking about" moment. Odds are intentionally NOT shown in the UI — part of the fun of
# a mystery box is not knowing the exact percentages — but every constant below is easy to
# retune, and none of it touches the character/harem economy, so it carries none of the
# spawn-limit or duplicate-catch risk a "win a character" tier would.

# is_limited_edition card owners — that payout is gone. The LE tagging system itself, /addle,
# /mergele, and the harem gallery are unaffected.)
# Public and visible on purpose. Runs on BOTH bots (2026-08, per owner request): bot3

# bot1's version alone covers every group.
#
# ⚡ PERFORMANCE: the overwhelming majority of messages are from users who aren't Premium, so
# this is designed to cost ZERO database reads for that case after their first message of the
# day. daily_first_msg_gate (in BotState) is an in-memory {user_id: date_str} set the INSTANT a
# user's first message of the day is seen — with no `await` between the check and the set, so a
# burst of that same user's messages across many groups in the same moment can only ever pass
# through once, not once per message — and every later message that same day is a single dict
# lookup, nothing more. This is purely a speed short-circuit: the actual once-per-day guarantee
# still comes from premium_gift_date in Mongo via an atomic find_one_and_update, so a bot
# restart mid-day just costs one extra DB read per user on their next message, never a
# double-grant.

# "Tries" is the important word: if bot3.send_message() fails for ANY reason — it lost its
# connection, it's no longer actually in the room, a permissions issue, anything — this falls
# straight back to sending via bot1 instead of leaving the command silently unanswered. A game

# 🎰🏀🎲 CASINO — NATIVE TELEGRAM DICE-MESSAGE GAMES
# =========================================================
# 🩹 REWRITTEN (2026-08, per owner request): /slot used to hand-animate its reel by repeatedly
# EDITING one message with random symbols, then editing it again for the real result — each
# spin was several edit calls, which is exactly the kind of per-chat edit burst that risks
# tripping Telegram's flood limits under load. Now sends Telegram's own native dice message
# (InputMediaDice) instead: Telegram animates it client-side for free, the outcome is decided
# server-side and comes back in the SAME send call (no polling, no edits at all), and it just
# looks like the real thing instead of a text reel. 🏀 Basketball and 🎲 Dice later joined /slot
# on this same engine — see _casino_play below for the full flow, and each game's own paytable
# note further down for how its raw dice value maps to a win.
#
# 🩹 REVERTED FOR /slot ONLY (2026-09, per owner request): the native dice message can never be
# edited — Telegram simply doesn't allow it — so every single spin still had to SEND one brand
# new message no matter what, even after the edit-in-place result card (_casino_edit_or_send)
# stopped the summary text itself from piling up. That leftover fresh-send-per-spin was the last
# real source of group spam, and there's no way to close it while /slot still rides Telegram's
# own dice. So /slot is back to drawing its own outcome bot-side (bot-drawn tiers replacing the
# native value-decode below) — same
# spirit as the pre-2026-08 system this file used to run, MINUS the old multi-edit spin
# animation that caused a different flood problem back then: a spin is now exactly ONE edit,
# landing straight on the static final result, no fake spinning frames. 🏀 Basketball and 🎲 Dice
# were NOT part of this request and still use Telegram's native dice exactly as before (2026-08
# section below, untouched) — every /slot/basketball/dice spin+roll now genuinely never sends a
# fresh message once the shared result-card session exists, EXCEPT basketball/dice's own native
# dice animation message, which is unavoidable for those two specifically.
#
# 🩹 REVERTED BACK TO NATIVE, /slot ONLY (2026-09, round 2, per owner request — players missed
# the real animation enough to bring it back): the bot-drawn detour above lasted about as long
# as it took players to notice. Reintroducing InputMediaDice for /slot necessarily reintroduces
# the per-spin animation-message send this whole rewrite exists to minimize (native dice can't
# be edited, full stop — see above) — that trade was made deliberately, not overlooked, because
# the alternative (fake it with a native-looking animation that doesn't decide the real payout)
# would have broken the "shown result always matches what's paid" honesty rule from the FIRST
# request in this whole saga. See SLOT_JACKPOT_MULT below (right where /slot's paytable lives)
# for how the jackpot rate/multiplier trade-off is handled instead — Telegram's dice value is
# genuinely server-random and can't be reweighted, so probability control was given up in favor
# of multiplier control, which stays fully honest.
#
# Dice messages can't be edited (Telegram limitation) and don't carry buttons of their own, so
# there's no more persistent "session" screen to edit bets on — every /slot [amount] (or tap of
# a preset/"spin again" button) is now one complete, self-contained spin: deduct → send the
# native dice → resolve the result → reply with a summary + a "🔄 Spin Again" button. This also
# drops the old min-3-spins-before-cashout rule and the cashout profit tax entirely — winnings
# already paid out per-spin before, so there was never actually anything held back to "cash
# out"; that screen was pure UI, not a real escrow.
SLOT_MIN_BET = 1
# 🩹 (per owner request) — hard cap, ⭐ per spin. Also see AML_BUST_THRESHOLD's own fix note
# just below (try_deduct_bet_bot3): that ceiling used to sit at a broken 10⭐ post-USD-retirement,
# which would have silently blocked any bet at or above this new max — raised alongside this.
# 🩹 RAISED (2026-09, per owner request): 50,000 → 100,000. AML_BUST_THRESHOLD raised in lockstep
# (110,000) to keep the same headroom above this — a max-size bet must never itself trip AML-bust.
SLOT_MAX_BET = 100_000
SLOT_BET_PRESETS = [10, 50, 100, 1_000, 10_000, 50_000]

# this chat instead of sending a brand new banner+caption every time — see
# _casino_edit_or_send(). This is how long a message stays "reusable" before a spin just sends
# a fresh one instead (message got too old to edit, or Telegram simply won't have it anymore).
DICE_SESSION_MAX_AGE = 600  # seconds (10 minutes)

# 🚦 NEW (per owner request — anti-spam): a player gets CASINO_COOLDOWN_TRIGGER plays across
# /slot, /basketball, and /dice (they share this same counter — it's one casino, not three),
# then is locked out of all three for CASINO_COOLDOWN_SECONDS. The counter resets to 0 the
# moment a lock is applied, so the same rule fires again on their next burst. This is on top
# of — not instead of — the edit-in-place fix above: that stops each individual spin from
# spamming a fresh message, this stops a player from spinning nonstop in the first place.
CASINO_COOLDOWN_TRIGGER = 10   # plays
CASINO_COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 60   # seconds locked out once the trigger count is hit

# 🚦 NEW (2026-09, per owner report — screenshots showed slot spam again despite the edit-in-
# place fix above): editing the SAME message forever is exactly what that fix intends, but
# Telegram itself rate-limits how many times one message can be edited in a burst — and at the
# time this was added, /slot had briefly lost its ~2.5s animation-sync sleep (mid-rewrite, since
# reverted — see the paytable's own history above), so nothing was pacing rapid repeat taps and

# 62, 63), where the non-seven symbol lands in reel 1 or 2 instead, were falling through to
# "lose" — meaning those spins visually showed 7️⃣7️⃣ (a two-sevens win by every visible

# must always match the payout" rule from the very first request in this whole thread. This

# time, not the 3/64 (≈4.69%) the old odds comment (and every RTP estimate given earlier in
# this thread) assumed. At the ORIGINAL multipliers (30x/7x/2x) this means the slot machine's
# real historical RTP was (30×1 + 7×3 + 2×9)/64 = 69/64 ≈ 107.8% — mathematically guaranteed to

# ==========================================
# 🃏 /cardgame — NEW (2026-09, per owner request): PVP, group-only, 2+ players. One host sets
# the bet, anyone in the group can Join for that same amount, the host Starts once enough
# people are in, and the highest of a UNIQUE set of 1-10 cards wins the whole pot minus the
# owner's cut. Deliberately its OWN standalone flow rather than a 4th entry in GAMES/
# _casino_play above — those are all "one player vs the house, resolved instantly"; this is
# "N players vs each other, resolved once the host says so", which needs an actual multi-step
# lobby (join roster, a Start gate, real per-player escrow) that the single-player casino
# engine was never built to hold.
#
# 🎴 CARD DEALING — why 1-10, always UNIQUE, no ties possible: _cardgame_deal() draws N
# DISTINCT values out of 1-10 (random.sample, no replacement) instead of N independent
# 1-10 rolls. With independent rolls, two players landing on the same number would need an
# explicit tie-break rule that was never specified — drawing without replacement removes the
# question entirely: with only 10 distinct values in existence, no two players can ever hold
# the same one, so "the highest card wins" always has exactly one answer. This is also the
# reason CARDGAME_MAX_PLAYERS is capped at 10 — an 11th distinct value doesn't exist.
#
# 💰 PAYOUT MATH — owner's example was 5 players × 1,000⭐: winner gets 4,000⭐, owner gets
# 1,000⭐. Generalized: pot = bet × N; owner's cut is a flat ONE bet's worth (which, since
# every player stakes the same amount, is exactly pot ÷ N); the winner gets everything else
# (pot − bet = bet × (N−1)). Heads-up on the N=2 edge case this generalization implies: with
# only the minimum 2 players, the winner's payout (1 × bet) exactly equals their OWN stake
# back — they don't net any actual profit, only the loser's bet moves (straight to the
# owner). That's a direct, unavoidable consequence of "owner's cut is always worth one full
# bet" holding at every N — flag it here in case a minimum-2 game feeling like a non-event for
# the winner isn't the intended feel; raising CARDGAME_MIN_PLAYERS to 3 would avoid it
# entirely (3-player winner nets +1 bet instead of breaking even).
#
# 🔒 ESCROW — a player's bet is taken (try_deduct_bet_bot3, same AML-jail/bust path every
# other casino game uses) the MOMENT they tap Join, not deferred to Start. That money is real
# and gone from their balance while the lobby sits open, which is exactly why this lobby needs
# its own timeout+refund watchdog (_cardgame_lobby_timeout_watchdog) — unlike a single /slot
# spin that resolves in one function call, a lobby can sit open for minutes with real Star
# already collected from real players, and if the host simply never starts it, that money
# needs a way back.

# =========================================================
# 🎰 ROULETTE / CARDGAME / FLIP / DICE / HI-LO — REMOVED (2026-08, per owner request: every
# casino game except /slot is gone. /slot below is the only one left, rebuilt to use
# Telegram's own native 🎰 dice-message animation instead of hand-edited frames.)
# =========================================================

# 🎁 REWORKED (per owner request): /daily now pays BOTH ⭐ Star AND 💠 VLT, shown behind an
# inline "Claim" button instead of landing instantly — same two-step "offer, then tap to
# collect" shape as the Premium daily Star gift above (see pending_premium_gifts). The 24h
# cooldown + streak are locked in ATOMICALLY the moment /daily runs (the find_one_and_update
# below), before the button ever appears, so there's no way to rack up more than one offer a
# day by spamming /daily and only tapping later — only the ALREADY-COMPUTED reward amounts
# wait on the tap, not the cooldown itself. This also closes a small pre-existing race (two
# /daily's landing at almost the same instant used to both read the same "not claimed yet"
# state and could, in theory, both write a grant — the atomic compare-and-swap below means
# only one of them can ever win a given day's slot).
#
# 🩹 Amounts bumped up noticeably (per owner request — "give more"): Star base is roughly 3x
# its old 20-500 range, streak bonus cap is 2x its old 300. VLT is a brand-new addition here —
# kept deliberately small in raw units (0.3-1.5 base, +0-1.0 more at a long streak) because
# 1💠 is worth 266-866⭐ on the open market (see VLT_RATE_MIN/MAX above) — even this modest-
# looking range is a genuinely generous daily bonus once converted, without /daily alone
# dwarfing every other VLT source in the game (artist card rewards, /buyvlt, etc.).

# Two separate bugs made it fail completely (silently — no reply, no error visible to the

#   1. Telegram's HTML parse mode does NOT support a `style` attribute on <pre> (or any
#      tag) — only a bare <pre> or <pre><code class="language-x">. Sending it raised a
#      "can't parse entities" error from Telegram, which the reply call never caught.
#   2. Even with that fixed, the text itself is ~4280 characters — over Telegram's hard
#      4096-char message limit — so it would still have failed to send on length alone.
# This splits the body across as many plain <pre> messages as needed, breaking only on
# line boundaries, so it always sends regardless of how long the list of commands grows.
